"""Data-driven initialization of a `StudentLMModel` from a loaded teacher `LMModel`.

This is the part of the pipeline the plan calls out as mattering most: a
randomly-initialized 20-layer/2048-dim/GQA-4:1 student, dropped in front of a
frozen depth transformer it was never trained with, will not produce anything
resembling the teacher's discrete token distribution. Every step here exists to
give the student a head start that is at least structurally aligned with the
teacher before any gradient step is taken.

Because the teacher has no GQA (`num_key_value_heads == num_heads == 32`, plain
MHA -- see distill/gqa_attention.py's docstring), "mean-pool teacher KV heads
into groups" is implemented as: pool groups of *all* 32 teacher heads' K/V
projection rows into `num_key_value_heads` bands (no heads dropped), while
query heads are reduced by strided selection (matching plan's the intent that a
GQA-4:1 student should still see a broad, representative slice of the
teacher's 32 attention heads).

Steps, run in order by `initialize_student`:
  1. `compute_layer_scores`      -- score[l] = 1 - cos(h[l], h[l+1]) per teacher layer.
  2. `select_layers`             -- top-`num_layers` by score, always keeping the
                                     first/last `keep_first`/`keep_last`, order preserved.
  3. `compute_residual_projection` -- one global activation-aware SVD basis
                                     (4096 -> hidden_size) shared by every selected layer,
                                     the embeddings, and the bridge.
  4. per selected layer: `init_attention_layer` (head selection + KV pooling + residual
     projection) and `init_ffn_layer` (own per-layer SVD of the FFN's gated-hidden space).
  5. `init_embeddings`           -- project teacher embedding tables through the same
                                     residual projection.
  6. `init_bridge_least_squares` -- closed-form regression of the Bridge so the frozen
                                     depth transformer gets a roughly-correct input at step 0.
  7. `sanity_check_student`      -- coarse, automatable degeneracy checks. This is a
                                     heuristic gate, not a quality guarantee: LISTEN to the
                                     output before starting a real training run.

    Unlike the residual stream, the FFN hidden dimension sits behind an
    ELEMENTWISE nonlinearity (`activation(gate) * value`, per channel). An SVD
    rotation of that space (as an earlier version of this function did, mapping
    it through a `compute_activation_projection`-style basis, symmetric to how
    the residual is handled) is mathematically wrong: a rotation mixes
    channels together BEFORE the nonlinearity is (conceptually) re-applied,
    but the actual elementwise nonlinearity in `gating_forward_kernel` only
    ever sees the ORIGINAL, unrotated channel basis -- `activation(x @ R) !=
    activation(x) @ R` for a rotation `R` in general. This showed up as a
    large (~0.6 max-abs-logit), layer-compounding numerical error in
    tests/test_init_sanity.py that was NOT present in the attention path
    (which stays entirely linear, aside from softmax's normalization, and
    doesn't touch this hidden space at all).

    The correct reduction here is the same idea already used for attention
    heads: SELECT a subset of the teacher's hidden channels (by activation
    RMS) rather than rotating into a new basis. Selection preserves the
    elementwise correspondence exactly -- each kept channel is still
    `activation(gate_c) * value_c` for the SAME original channel `c`, just
    fewer of them.

    every OTHER parameter's gradient a few training steps later via
    `clip_grad_norm_` (a single non-finite gradient makes the whole-model clip
    coefficient non-finite, corrupting the entire model on that optimizer step).
